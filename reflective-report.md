# 1 Introduction

Software vulnerabilities are a major concern in the world today. It is therefore the programmer's responsibility to consider the cybersecurity implications in the initial stages of writing source code. For this report, however, I will reflect upon my programming learning progression path and provide examples of where cybersecurity practices have been integrated. Furthermore, I will also be discussing how I can incorporate potential cybersecurity practices into my future programming implementations.

The report is composed of three sections. First, a brief overview of my programming journey and the path it took to develop those initial skills before starting my degree, during the duration of the degree, and any new insights that I have learned recently â€“ but with a security context in mind.

Secondly, two examples of specific Java code or functionality and the relevant choices made to address any security vulnerabilities. This section will present a much more in-depth understanding of any development decisions that can lead to said vulnerabilities.

Finally, considering what I have learned now within my degree and in my own time, incorporate a security mindset in my programming whilst going forward in the future based upon the reflections I have undertaken.
