# 1 Introduction

Software vulnerabilities are a major concern in the world today. It is therefore the programmer's responsibility to consider the cybersecurity implications in the initial stages of writing source code. For this report, however, I will reflect upon my programming learning progression path and provide examples of where cybersecurity practices have been integrated. Furthermore, I will also be discussing how I can incorporate potential cybersecurity practices into my future programming implementations.

The report is composed of three sections. First, a brief overview of my programming journey and the path it took to develop those initial skills before starting my degree, during the duration of the degree, and any new insights that I have learned recently – but with a security context in mind where applicable.

Secondly, two examples of specific Java code or functionality and the relevant choices made to address any security vulnerabilities. This section will present a much more in-depth understanding of any development decisions that can lead to said vulnerabilities.

Finally, considering what I have learned now within my degree and in my own time, incorporate a security mindset in my programming whilst going forward in the future based upon the reflections I have undertaken.

# 2 My programming journey

## 2.1 Skills before starting the degree

Before beginning my university studies, I had a lot of exposure to computer programming. At a very young age, I would experiment with basic HTML and CSS, with the task of creating a simple web dashboard that supported weather, calendar, and news APIs (see [Appendix 5.1](#51-link-to-html-home-dashboard-github-repository)). The aim was to come up with a dashboard that can serve as a home daily dashboard to learn basic HTML tags and CSS styles whilst also implementing third-party APIs. This was also the first project in which I became introduced to version control concepts, i.e. GitHub, and the idea of commits, cloning repositories, etc.

I also have attended numerous coding boot camps that taught many programming languages. Starting with the Python one, we learned about more advanced concepts like OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and used it to develop a space invaders-style game. OOP this instance was highly beneficial as modules like Tkinter and Pygame operated in such a way. It helped me to build upon my Python programming fundamentals, (variables, functions, loops, and so on) that I learned in school. In addition, we learned the secure concepts of OOP and how it contrasts from just typical programming – how objects are encapsulated, polymorphism of objects, and explicit use of getter and setter methods.

Java boot camps I have attended, one teaching Java concepts and the other, similar to Python in a game development environment, helped me have more of an appreciation for the consistency in coding concepts learned in other languages – the only difference in syntax structure. In these boot camps, we learned about the differences between Java and Python in terms of interaction with compilers, portability, and more. Each programming language has their respective strength and weaknesses depending on the given scenario.
